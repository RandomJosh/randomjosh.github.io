                    <p class="text">This graphical image was taken and created by myself. I used two different pieces of software to do this, those being firstly vectr.com which allowed me to create this repeatable geometric background, and secondly I used Pixlr to incorporate this background to the image of myself, which I had to remove the background from. I made sure to define my eyes which are very central to the image and my face, making them pop and look deep. I also added more vibrance to the entire image to ensure that it looks bright and welcoming.</p>

                    <p class="text">I am an 18 year old boy, working as an apprentice for an IT company, where I currently work within the technical support team, providing support for our products and services. My main focus is Live Chat Agent, so when our customers come in online I chat to them and provide them with the information and guidance they require.</p>
                    <p class="text">For this Image I took a screenshot of my works webpage which is where our customers come to get in contact with us (Usually me as I am the main live chat agent). I, like the above image, added a lot of vibrance to myself to make my skin glow more and look more appealing. I also added the deep blue colour across to the eyes again to make them really stand out. I used Pixlr to make these edits as it offered the right amount of tools and features which I required.</p>

                    <p class="text">For this I tried to create an image which fit the purpose of showcasing my love of being a youtuber and also my LGBT side with the rainbow backdrop. I used Pixlr to do these edits and the youtube screen was a screenshot of one of my videos so I could get the layout. I also added a glow around myself to emphasis me in the image. The pose was meant to symbolise a stuck behind the screen styled look, which is why I also added in the glass pane texture over the main image.</p>

                    <p class="text">This is one of my more simplistic images, consisting of a simple black and white map of the UK and a personalised pindrop icon which I created using Vectr using a triangle and circle shape. I cut around my face using Pixlr and layered it ontop of the map and pindrop image so that it matched up. The pin is dropped in roughly the southern London area which is where I am from.</p>
