            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I am an 18 year old boy, working as an apprentice for an IT company, where I currently work within the technical support team, providing support for our products and services. My main focus is Live Chat Agent, so when our customers come in online I chat to them and provide them with the information and guidance they require.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I am also a Youtuber in my spare time where I post regular videos around different fun and entertaining topics, though I am beginning to film more LGBT+ videos soon as I am very passionate about these topics!</p>
            <br>
            <p>I am from the south of London, which isn't as bad as it sounds, despite the bad reputation, it is definitely a decent place to grow up. I have lived here since I was born back on the 22nd April 1998.</p>
